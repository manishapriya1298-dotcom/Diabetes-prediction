# Diabetes-prediction

Today, I worked with a dataset for predicting diabetes in patients. It contains 9 columns, 8 of which represent parameters such as the number of pregnancies, glucose level, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin, BMI, diabetes pedigree function, and age. The last column is the outcome, where 0 indicates no diabetes and 1 indicates diabetes. 

From my analysis, I concluded that this is unsupervised data because these parameters alone cannot reliably predict the diabetes outcome. For example, a patient with 13 pregnancies and a glucose level of 145 at the age of 57 still falls into the no diabetes category.
